# My TypeScript Journey: Earned Badges üèÜ

## Badges Overview

## Reflections
1. The first module gave an initial overview of TypeScript, explaining why it was created and how it serves as an improvement over JavaScript. I learned how to install TypeScript, set up a project and compile a ts file in js file.
2. In this module the benefits of TypeScript's static type system were explored. I learned how to declare typed variables, starting with primitive types and extending to object types. The module further introduced union and intersection types, showcasing their role in enhancing flexibility and precision in variable declarations.
3. There are no interfaces in JS, so this is a valuable feature in TS. I learned how to declare, instantiate and extend interfaces. The lab exercises involving the use of interfaces in TypeScript provided hands-on experience and bridged the gap between theory and practical implementation.
4. There are advantages of using types in functions. From required, optional, default, to rest parameters, the module provides a comprehensive exploration of diverse function scenarios. The inclusion of type aliases or interfaces for defining function types adds a layer of flexibility and clarity to the process.
5. I learned how to use TypeScript classes to describe the shape of objects, declare and instantiate classes, apply access modifiers, define static properties, declare a class that extends another class and an interface to ensure class shape.
6. In this module I learned to identify use cases for generics, define a generic function, declare a generic interface, declare a generic class and implement generic constraints.
7. Here the goal was to organize code using modules and learn to import an external type library.
8. And finally the last module explains the purpose of namespaces. I learned to implement single-file namespaces and multi-file namespaces. The design considerations for using namespaces and modules were explained.
